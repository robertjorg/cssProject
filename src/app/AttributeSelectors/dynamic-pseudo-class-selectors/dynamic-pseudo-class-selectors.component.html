<h1>Dynamic Pseudo Class Selectors</h1>
<h2>Hyperlink pseudo-class</h2>
<p>You can change these dynamically with the :link and :visited tags. :link has not been visisted and is a hyperlink.
  :visited is a link that has been visited based on browser history. You can have a place holder tag that doesn't have a link.
Make sure you don't fall into this trap.<br/>
a.external:link, a[href^="http"]:link {{'{'}} color: slateblue;{{'}'}} <- This will apply only to external links that have
not been visited</p>
