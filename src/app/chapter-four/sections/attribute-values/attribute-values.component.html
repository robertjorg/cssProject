<h1>Attribute Values</h1>
<div>You can find the value of an HTML attribute defined for the element by using the attr() expression.</div>
<p id="lookHere">You are able to add content by using the attr() attribute</p>
<div>The above p element has the following css p::before {{'{'}}content: "[" attr(id) "]";{{'}'}}<br/>
This would prefix the p element with the attribute id value. More on this in Chapter 15.</div>
